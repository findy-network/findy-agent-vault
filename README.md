# findy-agent-vault

Vault provides both

1. Data storage service for findy-agency clients
1. Abstraction/Convenience layer for [agency protocol APIs](github.com/findy-network/findy-agent-api) which can be used through GraphQL interface.

Vault provides currently only a GraphQL API but intends to support also GRPC in the future. As a findy-agency client you can use also the [findy-agent GRPC APIs](github.com/findy-network/findy-agent-api) directly, but will have to implement possible data storing and indexing capabilities yourself.

## Running with mock data

Service providing mock data can be launched with following steps:

1. [Install go](https://golang.org/dl/)
2. Run

   ```
   make run
   ```

This will launch the service in port 8085.

- Access graphiQL playground with browser: http://localhost:8085
- Configure URL `http://localhost:8085/query` to your own GQL-client.

See [sample client implementation](https://github.com/findy-network/findy-wallet-pwa).

### Authentication

Running the service in playground mode provides an endpoint for mock authentication token generation.
Visit http://localhost:8085/token to generate the token.
API requests should contain this token in header field for the authentication to succeed:

```
{"Authorization": "Bearer <TOKEN>"}
```

## Running locally with cloud agency

1. Declare following environment variables:

   ```bash
   export FAV_AGENCY_HOST="<AGENCY HOST e.g. agency.example.com>"
   export FAV_AGENCY_PORT="<AGENCY GRPC port e.g. 50051>"
   export FAV_AGENCY_CERT_PATH=".github/workflows/cert"
   export FAV_AGENCY_MAIN_SUBSCRIBER=false
   export FAV_DB_PASSWORD="my-secret-password"
   export FAV_JWT_KEY="<AGENCY JWT SECRET>"
   export FAV_SERVER_PORT=8085
   export FAV_USE_PLAYGROUND=true
   ```

1. Start local postgres container

   ```bash
   make db
   ```

1. Start vault

   ```bash
   go run .
   ```

1. TODO: write auth setup instructions

## Running with postgres and findy-agent

1. Start postgres and findy-agent in their own docker containers:

   ```bash
   make dev_build
   ```

   (After the images have been built with command above, you can restart the env faster with `make env`)

1. Onboard your agent to agency:

   ```bash
   go run tools/onboard/main.go
   ```

   Copy JWT token from the produced output.

1. Declare following environment variables:

   ```bash
   export FAV_SERVER_PORT=8085
   export FAV_USE_PLAYGROUND=true
   export FAV_AGENCY_PORT=50052
   export FAV_DB_PASSWORD="my-secret-password"
   export FAV_AGENCY_CERT_PATH=".github/workflows/cert"
   ```

1. Run vault:

   ```bash
   go run main.go
   ```

1. Open http://localhost:8085 and set token to headers section as [instructed](#authentication). Execute graphQL queries with the playground e.g.

   ```
   { user { id name } }
   ```

## Unit testing

Unit tests assume postgres is running on port 5433.

Launch default postgres container by declaring password for postgres user:

```bash
export FAV_DB_PASSWORD="mysecretpassword"
```

and running

```
make init-test
```

You can run all unit tests with command

```bash
go test ./...
```

For linting, you need to install [golangci-lint](https://golangci-lint.run/usage/install/#local-installation)

`make check` builds, tests and lints the code.
